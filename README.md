FXVNDER's pt-PT Language Pack for CS:GO

It adds all weapon name/skins translation to pt-PT aside with jokes and all sorts of stuff.
I made it because pt-BR version of the game translation has gun skin names translated etc. and I felt jealous of it, so I just started my own translation of it lol. seems logical, right?

To install, just go to the releases and download the latest.

This will probably be updated with recent cases/skins etc.

Source 2 might break it, I don't know, but it still works.



Changelog:

v1 - First release (idea) - only gun names translated

v2 - Skin names translated

v3 - More names and skins translated

v4 (Current) - Panorama UI ready + lot's of adding and updating
