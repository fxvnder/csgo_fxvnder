# IMPORTANT: IT MIGHT BE OUTDATED/DEPRECATED.
IF YOU'RE HERE FOR A PT VERSION OF THE BANANAGAMING TEXT MOD I RECOMMEND USING THE TRANSLATIONS ON HIS WEBSITE: https://maximhere.me/customizations/

FXVNDER's pt-PT Language Pack for CS:GO

It adds all weapon name/skins translation to pt-PT aside with jokes and all sorts of stuff.
I made it because pt-BR version of the game translation has gun skin names translated etc. and I felt jealous of it, so I just started my own translation of it lol. seems logical, right?

It also adds a custom-made version of Bananagaming's Text Mod in pt-PT.

# INSTALLATION:

To install, just do the following:
- Go to the releases page and download the latest version. 
https://github.com/fxvnder/csgo_fxvnder/releases

- Drop the file on "Your Steam Folder"\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource

- Then go to CS:GO launch commands and add "-language fxvnder"

This will probably be updated with recent cases/skins etc. if I have time to do so.

Source 2 (KEKW) might break it, I don't know, but it still works.
