# "csgo_fxvnder"

FXVNDER's pt-PT Language Pack for CS:GO

It adds all weapon name/skins translation to pt-PT aside with jokes and all sorts of stuff.
I made it because pt-BR version of the game translation has gun skin names translated etc. and I felt jealous of it, so I just started my own translation of it lol. seems logical, right?

It also adds a custom-made version of Bananagaming's Text Mod in pt-PT.

This will probably be updated with recent cases/skins etc.

Source 2 might break it, I don't know, but it still works.
